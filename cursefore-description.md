# HOTEL C

An observability solution for Hytale game servers built on the OpenTelemetry standard.

HOTEL C is a Java plugin that brings modern telemetry and monitoring capabilities to your Hytale server. It collects metrics and distributed traces, exporting them via OTLP to backends like Grafana, Prometheus, or Jaeger.

Whether you're running a single server or managing a Kubernetes cluster, HOTEL C provides the performance monitoring and APM insights you need. Track player activity, monitor server health, and debug issues with full distributed tracing support.

Works with any OTLP-compatible observability platform.
